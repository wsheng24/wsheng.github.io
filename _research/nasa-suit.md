The [NASA SUITS program](https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/nasasuits) invites students to design AR interfaces for spacesuits, aligning with NASA's goals for the Artemis mission and the need for advanced technologies to support lunar exploration.

Team Formation and Preparation
======
In June 2022, under the supervision and organization of [John Akers](https://jakers.tech/) from [UW Reality Lab](https://realitylab.uw.edu/), I and another UW CSE student, Evan Zhao, joined the project, and formed the initial team along with [Sanjit Singh](https://www.arlis.umd.edu/about-arlis/our-people/internship/sanjit-singh). Our early tasks involved reading past publications, familiarizing ourselves with Unity and MRTK development environments, and studying previous projects for better understanding and improvement. On September 15th, after NASA released specific mission details, Kelly Frost Davis and HaiChao Wang, master's students from [UW Human Computer Interaction & Design](https://mhcid.washington.edu/), joined our team. Together, under the guidance of [Professor Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman](https://www.irakemelmacher.com/), we completed and submitted Team Proposals. These proposals detailed our understanding of each task, our envisioned final product, the user testing process, reachout events, and the establishment of our team name, UW Astrohuskies.

Within the team, my role was the Development Team Leader.

Collaboration and Project Development
======
Upon receiving the Acceptance letter from NASA on December 8th, 2022, we collaborated with several [UW Aeronautics and Astronautics Department](https://www.aa.washington.edu/) students to work on the overall project development.
The project involved designing an Augmented Reality (AR) application for the Microsoft HoloLens 2, to be overlaid within a spacesuit visor. <br>

The objective was to assist astronauts during Extravehicular Activities (EVAs) conducted in outer space environments like the Moon and Mars. As part of the University of Washington (UW) Astrohuskies team, we focused on specific tasks such as egress procedures, geological scans of rocks, autonomous rover (ROVER) navigation, and navigating the astronaut back to the home base. Our design underwent three phases of user testing and was evaluated by NASA engineers during the Houston Test Week at Johnson Space Center.

Final Test Week and Project Outcome
======
In May 2023, we participated in the final test week held in Houston. The UW Astrohuskies team attended the event to showcase our AR application and demonstrate its capabilities. <br>

The application was designed to enhance astronaut operations and improve their efficiency during EVAs by providing vital information and guidance through the AR interface displayed within the spacesuit visor. The project aimed to create a user-friendly and intuitive experience for astronauts while adhering to the specific requirements of the NASA SUITS challenge.
